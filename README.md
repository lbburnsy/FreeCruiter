The usage of the application is dual-sided depending on whether the user signs up as a freelancer or employer 

As a freelancer:
The user is able to sign up and create an account by entering his/her personal and professional information into a form, the user can then select the job categories among the following: front-end, back-end, and full-stack. 

As an employer:
The user is able to create job listings by entering descriptive information about the role in a form including: job title, description, qualifications needed, and location. Similarly the employer will have the option to select from the three categories front-end, back-end, and full-stack. They would then have an Employers Jobs page where they can view, update, and delete the job listings that they've created.
